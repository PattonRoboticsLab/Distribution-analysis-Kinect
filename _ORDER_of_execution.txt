ANALYZE SINGLE DATASET: (same for left)

0. main (using 1 data set)
1. data_acquisition_accuracy (see how accurate Kinect collected joint coordinates)
2. newref_filt_Right (homogeneous transformation and filtering)
3. filtering_Results (see how it changes between before and after filtering)
4. plotMan (plotting man inside reference system)
5. cal_vel_acc_jerk (derivatives) + PLOT in 2D (in time) and 3D (in space)
7. countInBins and PlotDust --> histogram calculation
8. calc_coverage --> see ROM

Are the data we are using enough to predict the entire movement of a subject?
9. find_Pcorr_and_COD (calculate Pearson correlation and COD between two data using histogram results) 
10. random (find randomly sets of samples and see COD with complete set) + PLOT

JOINT ANGELS
11. calc_jointangles + PLOT 2D (in time) and 3D (in space)
12. calc_jointangles_vel_acc_jerk + PLOT 2D (in time) and 3D (in space)
12. random1D --> same but on joint angles + PLOT


COMPARE TWO DATASETS:

13. confrontROM_Right or confrontROM_Left - same as points 0-5
    calc_coverage --> see different volumes
    find_Pearson_correlation (calculate correlation between two data) 
    find_coef_correlation
